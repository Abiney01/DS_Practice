# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems, categorized by topic.  
It serves as both a learning resource and a personal reference.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The code is organized into folders by category. Each folder contains multiple problems related to that topic. Here's the current structure:

## 📁 Project Structure

 **DS_PRACTICE/**
  - [Arrays](./Arrays)
  - [Strings](./Strings)
  - [LinkedList](./Linked_list)
  - [Stack](./Stack)
  - [Queue](./Queue)
  - [Trees](./Trees)
  - [Recursion](./Recursion)
  - [Design](./design)

Each folder contains:
- 📄 Individual problem files (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `reverse_linked_list.py`)
- 📝 Comments and explanations where needed
- ✅ Efficient solutions where applicable

> Language used: `Python`

---

## 🚀 How to Use

You can:
- Browse by topic to find a specific kind of problem
- Read inline comments to understand the logic
- Use it for interview prep, learning, or revision

To run a solution:
```bash
# Example for Python
python3 Arrays/two_sum.py

```


## 📌 Goals:

- Master core DSA topics

- Improve problem-solving skills

- Track progress over time

- Build a reference for future interviews


📚 Sources of Problems
Most problems are inspired by:

- LeetCode

- Coding Ninjas

(No problem statements are copied – only personal solutions are provided.)
